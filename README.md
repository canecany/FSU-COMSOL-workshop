The workshop introduces multiphysics modeling using three fundamental COMSOL examples:
1. Heat Transfer
  2D steady-state heat conduction
  2D transient heat conduction
2. Fluid Flow
  Lid-driven cavity flow (classic CFD benchmark)
3. Electrical–Thermal Coupling (Multiphysics)
  Resistive wire heating using Joule heating and temperature rise in electric circuits
These examples demonstrate how to build physics interfaces, set up geometry, mesh, solve, and extract results using COMSOL.

The workshop references official COMSOL articles for deeper learning:
